[Popper.js](https://jquery.com/)

It also contains a form validation script (validate_form.js) and a script displaying random content (script_extra.js.)

### CSS
Bootstrap 4.1.3 (https://getbootstrap.com/) was used for designing layout.


### Mockup

The project contains /mockup folder, with mockup html files. All of them have been created using quickMockup (https://jdittrich.github.io/quickMockup/) and can be displayed in any browser.

### Icons

Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/) icon has been used instead of default Boostrap gliphycon for small screen navbar toggler.

## Tests
 
Initially project contained custom layout, however it has been changed to more Bootstrap-based to fix display issues.
After commiting changes, all the pages has been tested on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Safari) and different platforms (Windows 8-10, Ubuntu 16.04, OS X). The only issue is a known Chrome bug with displaying images.

All html files has been tested on https://validator.w3.org and passed tests with no errors or warnings.

Script_extra.js was tested manually for displaying different values as desired.
